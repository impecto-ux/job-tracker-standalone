# Creative Brief: Brutalist Portfolio
**Date:** 2026-01-15
**Theme:** Brutalist
**Product:** Personal Creative Portfolio
**Vibe:** Dark, Confident, Experimental

## 1. Project Intent
To create a high-impact, "no-nonsense" portfolio that treats the browser as a raw canvas. The site should feel less like a polished product and more like an exposed machine or an industrial tool. It must convey confidence through minimalism and scale.

## 2. Visual Language & Direction
*   **Typography:** Massive, overwhelming headings (e.g., Archivo Black or similar tight sans-serif). Monospace for body text to emphasize the "code" or "machine" aesthetic.
*   **Layout:** Grid-breaking, overlapping elements, or strict/rigid visible grid lines.
*   **Color Palette:** High contrast. Background: #050505 (Near Black). Foreground: #F0F0F0 (Off-white). Accent: #FF3300 (Safety Orange) or #00FF00 (Terminal Green).
*   **UI Elements:**
    *   Visible borders (1px solid).
    *   Sharp corners (0px border-radius).
    *   Marquee text for motion.
    *   Hover effects that invert colors instantly (no smooth fade).

## 3. Risks & Constraints
*   **Risk:** "Brutalist" can easily become "Broken" if not executed with precision. Alignment is critical.
*   **Risk:** Accessibility might suffer with experimental navigation. We must ensure core navigation is obvious even if styled aggressively.
*   **Constraint:** Performance must be instant. Brutalism implies raw speed.

## 4. Success Checklist
- [ ] **First Impression:** Users must understand the "confident" vibe immediately upon load.
- [ ] **Navigation:** Functional but stylized (e.g., sticky sidebar or corners).
- [ ] **Motion:** Jerky, instant, or physics-based (heavy) interactions. No "springy" default iOS feeling.
- [ ] **Responsiveness:** Must break down gracefully to mobile without losing the "raw" feeling.
